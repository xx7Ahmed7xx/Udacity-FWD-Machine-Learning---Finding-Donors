# FWD Machine Learning - Finding  Donors Project
In this humble repository, I'm showing what I have accomplished and learnt so far in supervised machine learning, by applying principles that I learned throughout the course in this project.
## What is it about?
The data is about citizens of US in 1994, where we can predict the income of an individual (whether he makes at most 50K$ or More).
## Techniuqes used
In this project, I supposed 3 models, using SVM, KNN and Logistic Regression, in the final part I continued with Logistic Regression.
## Observed results
The most key factors affecting a person's wage, Is Capital gain, Educational Level and Martial Status (ascending).
